                    <p>Chatrapati Shivaji I (Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale; Marathi pronunciation:  19
                        February 1630 – 3 April 1680[5]) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha
                        clan.[6] Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate
                        of Bijapur; that kingdom being the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally
                        crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.[7]

                        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal
                        Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.
                        Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building
                        forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil
                        administration with well-structured administrative institutions. He revived ancient Hindu
                        political traditions, court conventions; and he promoted the use of the Marathi and Sanskrit
                        languages, replacing Persian at court and in his administration.[7][8] Praised for his
                        chivalrous treatment of women,[9] Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including
                        Muslims[10] and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.[11]

                        Opinions about Shivaji have varied according to observer and across time; but nearly two
                        centuries after his death he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the
                        Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist
                        and hero of the Hindus
